# MongoDB $inc Operator Error
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a given value. However, providing a string value to `$inc` will result in an error or unexpected behavior. The solution shows how to resolve this issue by providing a valid numerical value to the `$inc` operator.
